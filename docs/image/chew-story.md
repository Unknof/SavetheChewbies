Chew and his chewbies are part of a StarCraft II Arcade game, developed by a bunch of passionate gamers. The name of the arcade map is Kerrigan Survival, which was originally released sometime in 201X (TBD). Since then, people from all over the world have spent countless hours improving it, slowly turning it into the game it is today.

StarCraft II is a real-time strategy game by Blizzard Entertainment, famous for its competitive multiplayer and its story-driven campaigns.

Chew’s story started with a silly idea — not even a real concept. Inspired by our long-term Kerrigan Survival moderator Chewbacca, Chew began as a very simple in-game pet: a snow matriarch from a distant, icy planet in the StarCraft II universe. Initially, Chew was meant as a heartfelt reward for Chewbacca’s long-term support and dedication to Kerrigan Survival, and it was only usable by him.

But when I looked at all the animations the unnamed artists (and if you know — or are — the person who created the Snow Matriarch model and animations, PLEASE let me know, because whoever you are deserves some serious credit!) had put into this model, I saw the potential for something more.

What started as a meme class, spawning tiny, adorable chewbies, gradually became an actual support class. I added more and more abilities, but always stayed true to the core concept: one Papa Chew and lots of baby chewbies as his “ehm”… slightly disposable family.

At one point, Chew became really strong — so strong that many players considered him overpowered. Sadly, during this period I was too busy with real-life stuff, so with a heavy heart I disabled Chew temporarily. For a few months now, players could no longer play him at all, until I would eventually find the time to make the class great again.

A couple of months later, I felt it was finally time for Chew’s long-anticipated return. Some players were already getting a bit anxious, and I honestly felt guilty for making them wait so long. So I started a very openly communicated rework of the class, giving the community lots of insight and even asking for ideas to make Chew as good as possible.

I was on a good track — but then I got sidetracked by… something. I’m not even sure what anymore. I think I remembered my original Chew pet concept, and a somewhat twisted idea formed in my mind:

“Let me just be a lil bit more me and create Baby Chew first.”

For a long time, many people (including devs) believed Kerrigan Survival to be a dying arcade in the slowly dwindling RTS genre. But as it turns out, our player base on the CN server is actually larger than EU and NA combined. That realization sparked a ton of motivation to create something I would personally consider amazing.

So I made Baby Chew.

And no — I didn’t just make a tiny thing that follows you around like the original pet. Quite the opposite. Baby Chew has tons of small interactions, hidden references, and jokes about long-forgotten abilities (RIP Feign Death). Baby Chew can be used by all 10 players simultaneously, creating a healthy amount of extra mayhem during matches.

At first, Baby Chew could only be summoned via a special chat command. Shortly after the later mentioned tournament, I added a proper button instead. Creating Baby Chew worked out so well that I genuinely felt it had the potential to become something even bigger.

Purely by coincidence, shortly after my return to KS, I heard about a big tournament happening on the CN server on January 10th / 11th. I spent an hour or two polishing Baby Chew just in time so he could be revealed during the event.

To further incentivize players, I offered to donate money to charity (Save the Children):
$1 per Baby Chew spawned during the tournament.

However, since the matches were high-level competitive play — and Baby Chew can actually be a bit of a disadvantage (he makes it easier to track your hero) — he didn’t get much screen time. Only 6 Baby Chews were spawned in total (out of a possible 100).

So I went with $10 per Baby Chew myself.

But what about the baby chewbies?

Those 6 Baby Chews managed to amass a total of 351 baby chewbies across just two games. And since I’ve clearly become somewhat of a Chew myself, I thought:

“Somebody needs to take care of all these chewbies.”

So I created the very website you are on right now.

To further incentivize donations for a good cause, I’m offering to continue improving Baby Chew for everyone!
(Yes, this currently means CN server only, because Baby Chew cannot be added to EU/NA right now. That’s not on us — it’s on Blizzard — but they promised to fix it Soon™)

By donating to help children around the world, you’re also helping make Baby Chew even better.
And believe me when I tell you: he’s already pretty fuckin’ great.

Important note: Baby Chew does not replace the original Chew.
Chew will return to Kerrigan Survival (CN only for now) before the end of January 2026.

Much love — and save the chewbies ❤️
